## Hello, future contributors!

- ### I coded the program in python using VSC, but feel free to use whatever editor you like

- ### I tested using the VSC terminal, but you can also run the .py file in command prompt as well

- ### I'm not worried about submissions, feel free to share your forks however you like

- ### My comms are closed, so if something doesn't make sense, sorry :/
---
- ### Things that remain to be improved upon are as follows:
    - #### Add functionality for time zones out side of EST
    - #### Optimize code any way you can
    - #### If you find a way to just rewrite the whole program but have it still do the same thing, that's cool too
